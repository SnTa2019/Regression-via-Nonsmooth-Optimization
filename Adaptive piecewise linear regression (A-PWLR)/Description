Adaptive piecewise linear regression (A-PWLR) is a method for solving regression problems. This method is very efficeint and accurate particularly in data sets with outliers.
The piecewise linear regression problem is formulated as an unconstrained nonconvex nonsmooth optimization problem, where the objective function is presented as a difference
of two convex (DC) functions. To address the nonconvexity of the problem A-PWLR builds piecewise linear estimates in an adaptive way using an incremental approach, and the 
aggregate subgradient method for nonsmooth DC optimization is applied to solve the underlying optimization problems.
