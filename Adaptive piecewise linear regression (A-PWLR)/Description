Adaptive DC clusterwise linear regression (ADC-CLR) is a method for solving large-scale regression problems. The method is designed based on
the difference of convex algorithm (DCA) and the incremental approach.
The regression problem is formulated as an unconstrained nonconvex nonsmooth optimization problem, where the objective function is represented
as a difference of two convex (DC) functions. DCA is applied to replace this DC-CLR problem by sequence of smooth convex optimization problems.
ADC-CLR algorithm applies the incremental approach to generate starting points which are rough solution to the DC-CLR problem, and subproblems 
are solved by utilizing the Quasi-Newton method.
