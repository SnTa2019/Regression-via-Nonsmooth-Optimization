Adaptive piecewise linear regression (A-PWLR) is a method for solving regression problems. This method is very efficeint and accurate particularly in data sets with outliers.
The piecewise linear regression problem is formulated as an unconstrained nonconvex nonsmooth optimization problem, where the objective function is presented as a difference
of two convex (DC) functions. Auxiliary problems are introduced to design an adaptive approach to generate a suitable piecewise linear regression model and starting points for 
solving the underlying DC optimization problems. The aggregate subgradient method for nonsmooth DC optimization is applied to solve thse problems.
