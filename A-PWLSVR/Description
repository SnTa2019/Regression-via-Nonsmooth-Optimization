The adaptive piecewise linear support vector regression method (A-PWLSVR) is a regression method that uses the L1-risk function to define 
regression errors and applies support vector machine approach in combination with the piecewise linear regression to develop a new model 
for regression problems. The regression problem is formulated as an unconstrained nonconvex nonsmooth optimization problem, where the 
objective function is presented as a difference of two convex (DC) functions. To address the nonconvexity of the problem A-PWLSVR builds
piecewise linear estimates in an adaptive way using an incremental approach. The double bundle method for nonsmooth DC optimization (DBDC) 
is applied to solve the underlying optimization problems.
