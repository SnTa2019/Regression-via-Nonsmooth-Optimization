Adaptive DC clusterwise linear regression (ADC-CLR) is a method for solving large-scale regression problems. The method is designed based on 
the difference of convex algorithm (DCA) and the incremental approach. 
The regression problem is formulated as an unconstrained nonconvex nonsmooth optimization problem, where the objective function is represented 
as a difference of two convex (DC) functions. Then this problem is replaced by the sequence of smooth unconstrained optimization subproblems. 
To address the nonconvexity of the new CLR problem ADC-CLR builds linear estimates in an adaptive way using an incremental approach, and the
subproblems are solved by utilizing the Quasi-Newton method.
